# Deploying with Docker

You can deploy single containers at the command line with the `docker run` command. This is not actually the easiest way to do things (docker-compose is easier) but it's useful to go through the basics.

*If you're not pulling a ready-built image from a container repository then you'll need to build the image from a Dockerfile first! See https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/ for more details*

The full `docker run` syntax can be found at https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/
